# Timetaken
This is a program that first asks the user to enter the distance that a sound wave will travel and then asks the user to enter a medium for travel of "air", "water", or "steel". The value for medium should not be case sensitive (for example: AIR, air, Air, AiR are all valid entries). An error message should be displayed if the user enters an invalid medium.
When a valid entry for medium has been made, the program should calculate and display the amount of time it will take for the sound to travel. This value should be formatted to 2 decimal places.
You can calculate the amount of time it takes sound to travel in air with the following formula:
time = distance / 1100
You can calculate the amount of time it takes sound to travel in water with the following formula:
time = distance / 4900
You can calculate the amount of time it takes sound to travel in steel with the following formula:
time = distance / 16400
